# Security CI Pipeline

A streamlined GitHub Actions pipeline for comprehensive security checks, including scans for vulnerabilities in container images, code dependencies, source code, and detection of exposed secrets.

## Usage

1. Add the workflow file to `.github/workflows/security.yml`.
2. The pipeline triggers automatically on:
   - Pushes to `main`
   - Pull requests targeting `main`
   - A scheduled run every Sunday
3. Review detailed scan results in the repository's **Security** tab.
